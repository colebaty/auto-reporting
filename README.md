# Overview
This is a fork of [noraj/OSCP-Exam-Report-Template-Markdown](https://github.com/noraj/OSCP-Exam-Report-Template-Markdown). 

The goal is to help streamline report writing during labs/pentesting

Uses Eisvogel LaTeX template.

## Intent
The intent for this to be used as a "starter" for reporting on tests, labs, etc.  This was designed for the Obsidian Markdown editor in order to take advantage of some of the native features as well as community plugins.

For example, by using the Paste Image Rename plugin, we can quickly add descriptive filenames to images as we add them to the project.  This filename is processed in such a way that Pandoc automatically renders it as the figure descriptions in the resulting report.
